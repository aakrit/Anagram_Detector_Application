Anagram Detector Application

This project is implemented with performance in mind. The goal is to scan a file with list of words and while scan check to see that for any current word scanned, if its a anagram of any of the previous words scanned, print to Console True, else print False.

Please find attached a UML diagram for the layout of all objects used in implementing the functionality of the application. Also you will find some comments within the code to help illustrate parts of the implementation where necessary.

Input: list of words read from file
Assumptions:
  1. Words are made up of only lower case ANCII Character set: [a-z]
  2. Words can be arbitrary in size ranging from 2 to at most 100 (max 100 for the sake of illustration)
  3. Duplicate words can be stored randomly
  4. The file may contain lines with no words or multiple words. Such lines will be ignored

Output: to Console
  - Boolean Values expressing if the current word is an anagram of a previous word or not
